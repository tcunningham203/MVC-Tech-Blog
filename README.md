## Credits

The code featured in the second commit "starter code from my castles project for file structure and login form" was taken from the following repo: https://github.com/tcunningham203/100-famous-castles. I spent a lot of time on this project and it covers a lot of the same ground as this project. I was meant to do THIS (tech blog) project first, but I ended up doing them out of order. Because so much of the work had already been done, I decided to use the castles project as the basis for the starter code- specifically, the MVC file structure and the login screen. Then, I gradually removed and altered elements until the requirements for this project were met. 

I used various learning resources like Stack Overflow and W3 schools to help with random questions I had, in particular the delete fuction.
